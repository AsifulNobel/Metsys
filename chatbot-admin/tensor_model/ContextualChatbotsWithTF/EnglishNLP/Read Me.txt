This is a really great example of training bot with real life conversation. 
And this bot can keep track of the context.

To take a grasp of how this code work.
First read this link 
Deep Learning in 7 lines of code - https://chatbotslife.com/deep-learning-in-7-lines-of-code-7879a8ef8cfb

Then this code is explained in this link.
Contextual Chatbots with Tensorflow - https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077


To run this code- 
You need to NLTK , NUMPY , TFLEARN , TENSORFLOW, RANDOM, PICKLE package of python.
I have used conda environment of Anaconda instead of default pip/pip3 environment of Python 2/3.
It is better. and also installed GPU supported version of Tensorflow for faster calculating.
But for that you also need to install Nvidia CUDA Toolkit and cuDNNv5.1 (not 6.0 mind it!)
But normal CPU based Tensorflow will work just fine.
And I have followed the step for installing Tensorflow with Anaconda.
