# on a path prefix, and then include routing from the chat module.

    # A default "http.request" route is always inserted by Django at the end of the routing list
    # that routes all unmatched HTTP requests to the Django view system. If you want lower-level
    # HTTP handling - e.g. long-polling - you can do it here and route by path, and let the rest
    # fall through to normal views.
